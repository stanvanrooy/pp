### Be a catalyst of change. 
Create something with resources you can reasonably ask for. Then say:
'Of course it _would_ be better if we added ...'. Pretend it's not
important and wait for them to start asking you to add functionality.

Show them a glimpse of the future and you'll get them to rally around.
