### How do you react when someone comes with a lame excuse, and what do you think of them and their company as a result?
- Irritated ->  I have more respect for someone being honest and telling
  the truth.
- Unreliable -> If they 'lie' about something like this, what else can /
  will they lie about?

### Be sure to follow up 'I don't know' with 'but I'll find out' - take responsibility
