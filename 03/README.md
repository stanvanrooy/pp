### Help your team by surveying the project. Come up with 2 broken windows, and discuss what can be done to fix them.
- TODO:

### Can you tell when a window gets broken? What is your reaction?
This probably depends on the project, and the current state of it. If
the project is well maintained, I'll care more about addressing the
issues, vs when the project is already in a bad state.

This is exactly what the author tries to describe. If a window is
broken, you'll care less about the second one being broken to.

__Learning points__
- Don't allow any windows to be broken, even if some others already are.
